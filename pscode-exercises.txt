// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 numbers together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for number
divide number by 2
IF remainder = 0 print 'even' 
ELSE print 'odd'

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) prompt for 5 numbers
   loop from 1-5 after each input
   assign input to an array 'numbers'

b) add (+) numbers from array 'numbers'
   divide (/) output by 5
   print output 'average'

c) load array 'numbers'
   IF number < min_number
   min_number = number
   IF number > max_num
   max_num = number
   print 'max_num' and 'min_num"

d)  b)print the average of all 5 numbers 
    c)find the smallest and largest numbers
      print on screen
